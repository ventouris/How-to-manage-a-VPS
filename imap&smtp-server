**Install Postfix and its dependencies:**

```
sudo apt-get install postfix libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules
```

Edit main.cf:

```
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

Add the following lines and save:

```
# sets gmail as relay
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587

# use tls
smtp_use_tls=yes

# use sasl when authenticating to foreign SMTP servers
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes

# path to password map file
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

# list of CAs to trust when verifying server certificate
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

smtp_sasl_security_options =
```

Edit sasl_passwd:

```
sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```

Add the following line and save:

```

Chown sasl_passwd:
