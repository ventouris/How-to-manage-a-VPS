# How to manage a VPS - The Linode Handbook

I am one of those users that (still) doesn't have any idea of unmanaged VPS. I wanted to leave the shared hosting and try the magic world of freedom on a VPS.

I spent days on collecting details and tutorials from several blogs and I had the idea to create a Handbook for new users. 

You are free to contribute with a pull request and suggest anything you believe will improve the Handbook.

It is still in a very alpha version without a decent structure or content, but I hope other, more experienced users will help on this.

You can also use the following slack team for discussion [https://linodehandbook.slack.com]()
