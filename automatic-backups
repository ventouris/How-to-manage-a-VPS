#Automatic Backups

###Backup your MySQL databases


Install automysqlbackup to get backups:

```
sudo aptitude install automysqlbackup
```

Open the configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/default/automysqlbackup
```

Find the line that begins with `BACKUPDIR=` and change it to `BACKUPDIR="/home/<your username>/backups/"`

Set automatic emails if something goes wrong by finding the line `MAILADDR=` and changing it to `MAILADDR="<your email address>".`

### Setup Automatic Backups

Open your crontab:

```
crontab -e
```

Add this line to the file:

```
@weekly rsync -r -a -e "ssh -l <your username on backup server> -p <ssh port number of backup server>" --delete /home/<your username> <hostname or ip address of backup server>:/path/to/some/directory/on/backup/server
```
